# Overview
This is currently *ALPHA* software, intended for wallstop studios internal use only. Feel free to use. Currently there is no support and there may be breaking changes. Once stabilized, I will ready this repo for production use.

# Contributing

This project uses [CSharpier](https://csharpier.com/) with the default configuration to enable an enforced, consistent style. If you would like to contribute, recommendation is to ensure that changed files are ran through CSharpier prior to merge. This can be done automatically through editor plugins, or, minimally, by installing a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts).
